# itp-residency-2019
Repo to document my ITP Something-In-Residency, Spring 2019


## General

Generally organized around supporting open source / open education, focusing on topics around data visualization, machine learning, and data colleciton, organization, and sharing.


# Ideas for how to spend my time

# Magic Tracks:

Magic Tracks (tentative name) is a web platform to turn project ideas into instant, pick-and-mix tutorials. Magic Tracks aims to help students and educators collaboratively build modular "recipes" that, when strung together, can guide learners "from A to B" through the process of ideation to creation.


Plans: 
- Use the Magic Tracks alpha to test with CODE!2 course

# ML5:

[ML5](https://ml5js.org/) is "friendly machine learning for the web". ML5 is an open source javascript library built on top of TensorFlow.js -- A JavaScript library for training and deploying ML models in the browser and on Node.js -- aimed to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students, directly in the web browser âœ¨.

My plan is to support the community around ML5 through various software and community efforts. 

Plans:
- issue tracking
- website updates & documentation
- example creation
- ml5 meetings and meet up

# Data Vis with P5.js + Magic Book:

Data visualization? with P5.js?! Why not?! When Ben Fry's "Visualizing Data" was first published in 2007, it was one of the first books detailing how to actually build data visualizations with code. First written in Processing -- an open source programming environment and community designed for artists and designers - "Visualizing Data" opened up for many (including myself) the power and wonder of taking a dataset, looking at its numbers and text, and building images and interactive things so that you and others could ride the roller-coaster that are data-driven visuals.

Since 2007, many visualization libraries and frameworks -- e.g. D3.js -- and platforms have emerged - e.g. Tableau, CARTO etc -- and the dominant environment for visualizing data has changed from static images, desktop software, and videos to dynamic and interactive environments in the web browser. Furthermore, there are oceans of tutorials and dozens (dare I say hundreds?) of books covering the topic of interactive data visualizaiton on the web. So why make another data visualizaiton book?

Many of the current resources around interactive visualization for the web currently are centered around D3.js - a popular data visualization and manipulation library. D3.js is a wonderfully powerful library with a great user community, but it is, in all its glory, more difficult to learn, especially for beginners to javascript and creative coding, in general. In order to address some of these entry barriers to data visualization on the web, this book is built around P5.js -- a javascript reimagination of Processing which was used for "Visualizing Data" all those years ago -- for a couple reasons. First, P5.js is taught here at ITP as a sort of "swiss-army knife" for creative coding, visualization, and even interfacing with hardware. Second, P5.js is a great pedagogical tool to walk through core skills and concepts for problem solving, structuring logic, and more. Last, with the [P5 Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org), it makes it easy to make, share and remix examples. 

This book is a guide to data visualization for people to learning P5.js and starting to work with data and web technologies.



Plans:
- data vis with p5.js cookbook
  - intro and concepts
  - P5.js intro
  - Lookbook section:
      - examples of data viz made in processing & p5.js
  - Examples:
      - example 1
      - example 2
      - example 3
      - example 4
  - Reference:
      + p5 function in context to data
